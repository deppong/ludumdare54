# About
You are scientist who has been studying rifts in reality for sometime. You never thought it could get this bad…

Shot in the Dark is an action top down shooter where you are limited to your small slice of reality. Many demons lurk beyond what is real and have a thirst to terminate you. They blast you with comic energy from the shadows. You cannot see what isn’t real but luckily in your research you developed a radar that detects such movements beyond what’s real. You have to use what little information you have to battle these unseen threats. While using your radar you are unable to move or shoot.
# How To Play:
Enemies are invisible but orbiting the player in circles, Use the Radar(Hold Right Click) to see how enemies are moving to try and figure out where they are.
- WASD for movement
- Mouse aims your rifle
- Left click fires
- Holding right click down is your radar, which pings your enemies’ positions twice.
